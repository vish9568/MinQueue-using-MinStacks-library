# MinQueue-using-MinStacks-library
This is implementation of queue using two stacks. That provides the basic functionalities of a queue with the added functionality of getting the smallest element currently in the queue in amortized O(1) timeâ€¦

The MinQueue uses two MinStacks to simulate the behaviour of a Queue. Functionalities :

1.push(x) : push element x at the back of the queue
2.pop : remove an element from the front of the queue.
3.top : return the element currently at the front of the queue.
4.getMin : return the current smallest element in the queue.

How to use:
1.first include the MinQueue.h file in the program as #include "MinQueue.h"
MinQueue < int > Q:
Q.push(22);
Q.push(1);
Q.push(10);
// currently Q looks like 22 -> 1 -> 10
// Q.getMin() returns 1.
